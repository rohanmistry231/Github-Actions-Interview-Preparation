# üìú Workflow Basics

This section covers the foundational concepts of GitHub Actions workflows, essential for building CI/CD pipelines and automation tasks. Below, you'll find detailed examples for each sub-topic, along with explanations to help you understand and apply these concepts.

## üèóÔ∏è Sub-Topics

### 1. YAML Syntax
GitHub Actions workflows are defined using YAML, a human-readable data serialization format. The example below shows a basic workflow with key YAML elements like key-value pairs, lists, and nested structures.

```yaml
# yaml-syntax.yml
# Main Learning Points: YAML Syntax
# YAML is the format used to define GitHub Actions workflows.
# Key elements include key-value pairs, lists, and nested structures.

# Workflow name
name: YAML Syntax Demo

# Trigger the workflow on push to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

# Define jobs
jobs:
  demo-job:
    # Specify the runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define steps
    steps:
      # A step with a name and a command
      - name: Print a message
        run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"

      # A step using an action from the marketplace
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # A step with environment variables
      - name: Run with environment variables
        run: echo "The value of MY_VAR is $MY_VAR"
        env:
          MY_VAR: "Hello World"
```

### 2. Workflow Triggers (`on` Events)
Workflows are triggered by events specified in the `on` keyword. This example demonstrates various triggers, including push events, pull requests, scheduled runs, and manual triggers.

```yaml
# workflow-triggers.yml
# Main Learning Points: Workflow Triggers (on Events)
# The 'on' keyword defines events that trigger the workflow.

name: Workflow Triggers Demo

# Multiple trigger events
on:
  # Trigger on push to specific branches
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  
  # Trigger on pull requests targeting specific branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  
  # Trigger on a schedule (every day at 12:00 UTC)
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * *'
  
  # Trigger manually via the GitHub UI
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      message:
        description: 'A custom message to print'
        required: true
        default: 'Hello from workflow_dispatch!'

jobs:
  trigger-demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Print trigger message
        run: echo "Workflow triggered! Message: ${{ github.event.inputs.message || 'Default message' }}"
  
      - name: Print event details
        run: echo "Event name: ${{ github.event_name }}"
```

### 3. Jobs and Steps
Jobs are independent tasks that run in parallel (unless dependencies are specified), and steps are the individual actions within a job. This example shows two jobs with a dependency between them.

```yaml
# jobs-and-steps.yml
# Main Learning Points: Jobs and Steps
# Jobs are independent tasks that run in parallel (unless specified).
# Steps are the individual actions within a job.

name: Jobs and Steps Demo

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # First job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        # Assuming a Node.js project for demo purposes

      - name: Run build
        run: npm run build

  # Second job, dependent on the first
  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

### 4. Runners (Hosted vs. Self-Hosted)
Runners execute workflows. GitHub provides hosted runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`), or you can set up self-hosted runners for more control. This example shows both types.

```yaml
# runners.yml
# Main Learning Points: Runners (Hosted vs. Self-Hosted)
# Runners execute workflows; GitHub provides hosted runners, or you can set up self-hosted runners.

name: Runners Demo

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  hosted-runner:
    # Using a GitHub-hosted runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run on hosted runner
        run: echo "Running on GitHub-hosted runner (Ubuntu)"

  self-hosted-runner:
    # Using a self-hosted runner (requires setup in your repository)
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run on self-hosted runner
        run: echo "Running on self-hosted runner"
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

To try these workflows:
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Create a `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository.
3. Add the `.yml` files above to the `.github/workflows/` directory.
4. Follow the instructions in each file to trigger and observe the workflows.
5. Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to view the workflow runs and logs.

These examples provide a solid foundation for understanding GitHub Actions workflows. Move on to the next sections of the roadmap to explore more advanced topics like CI/CD pipelines and custom actions!
